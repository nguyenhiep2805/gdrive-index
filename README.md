## What is this?

`next-gdrive-index` is a Google Drive directory index.
The aim of this project is to simplify the process of sharing files using Google Drive, and also add some features that _I think_ is useful when sharing a files.

> This project are **HEAVILY INSPIRED** by [onedrive-vercel-index](https://github.com/spencerwooo/onedrive-vercel-index) by [SpencerWooo](https://github.com/spencerwooo).

## Why I made this?

> **TLDR;**
> It is cheaper to use Google Drive than other similar service

There are a lot cloud storage service like Onedrive, Dropbox, Mega, etc.
But, between all those service, I think Google Drive is a lot cheaper than others (at least in my region).

Here are the pricing comparison between free and cheapest plan
_Price are converted to IDR, since it's easier for me to compare this using my own currency_

| Service          | Free plan       | Paid plan | Price                  | Price to Storage                            | Transfer Quota |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :-------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------: |
| **Google Drive** | 15GB            | 2TB       | 135k IDR<br>~112k IDR  | <u>14.8GB / 1k / mo<br>17.8GB / 1k / yr</u> |  **<u>X</u>**  |
| **Onedrive**\*\* | 5GB             | 1TB       | 96k IDR<br>80k IDR     | 10.4GB / 1k / mo<br>12.5GB / 1k / yr        |  **<u>X</u>**  |
| **Dropbox**\*    | 2GB             | 2TB       | ~191k IDR<br>~159k IDR | 10.5GB / 1k / mo<br>12.5GB / 1k / yr        |       O        |
| **MEGA**         | **<u>20GB</u>** | 2TB       | ~174k IDR<br>~145k IDR | 11.5GB / 1k / mo<br>13.8GB / 1k / yr        |       O        |

\* Price are in USD, and there are no regional price for IDR
\*\* There are no 2TB plan

By using this data, I picked Google Drive instead other service.
I know there are a lot of people selling cheap education account especially for Google Drive and Onedrive, but most of the time <u>those account doesn't last long</u>.

## Known Issues

### File size limit

> This only apply if `maxFileSize` is enabled / more than 0

You need to set the file sharing permission to `Anyone with the link can view` on the root folder.

**Why?**
The download link will be redirected if the file you're trying to download is bigger than the `maxFileSize`, and most of platform are limiting the response body size (ex: Vercel limit is 4MB).  
If you don't set the permission, people can't access or download the file.

This will <u>expose the file ID</u>, and people can access the file directly from Google Drive.  
But it <u>only apply to the file</u>, and they can't see or browse the folder directly from Google Drive.

### No support for Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides

For now, I don't have any plan to implement this, because I think it's not necessary.

### ~~Can't seek on audio and video preview~~

~~It looks like you can't seek the audio and video preview, so you need to listen / watch from the beginning.~~
Fixed on v2.0.2

### ~~Shared Drive is not supported~~

~~I don't have Shared Drive, so I can't test it and implement it~~
Implemented by [@loadingthedev](https://github.com/loadingthedev) [(PR #4)](https://github.com/mbahArip/next-gdrive-index/pull/4)

## Might be Implemented

Here are things that I want, and might be implemented on the future

### Internationalization / i18n

It should be a good idea to have the site and deploying guide with multiple language support.

### Multiple drive

It's either from multiple Google Drive account with multiple Service Account, or a basic single Google Drive account with multiple root start point either in their own Drive or Shared Drive

### Authentication

Probably a good feature if you are a content creator that only want the one who subscribed to you get the files.  
It might need a database, but idk if I can implement it without the need of database
